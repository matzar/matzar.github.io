<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>It was my first Unity project and I still did not have much programming experience so the game is fairly simple. Today I would probably do many things differently but there is still some cool stuff in here and I had learned a lot during this project.
One of many challenges was to learn unity’s animator. And this probably took most of my time since I had redone the animation code a couple of times. The other thing was to have the player move horizontally and vertically after choosing the direction and not let the player change it unless he had hit the wall. All those were basic mechanics for the game and I was quite pleased with the result. Especially that I had managed to achieve all of this.</p>

<h2 id="high-concept-statement">​High Concept Statement</h2>

<p>​In this game you play as a dragon and you need to escape a tricky maze full of deadly spikes. But you must be careful for you can only move vertically or horizontally and once you have chosen the direction you cannot change it until you hit a wall!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Collectable coins. Every coin increases your score by 10.</li>
  <li>A chasing lava which when touched will kill you.</li>
  <li>Deadly spikes which when touched will kill you.</li>
  <li>Animation of an idle, a flying and a dead dragon.</li>
  <li>Score displayed at the top of the screen.</li>
  <li>After you have died or finished the game you press ‘R’ to restart the game. Press ‘ESC’ to end the game at any point.</li>
  <li>You win when you reach the end of the maze.</li>
  <li>Custom made, pixelated sounds of coins collecting and spikes hitting.</li>
  <li>Royalty free soundtrack. One for the gameplay and one to celebrate the victory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="genre-and-target-audience">Genre and Target Audience</h2>

<p>It is an action/puzzle game where you need to quickly find a safe passage through the maze full of deadly spikes. The target audience are casual mobile players who do not spend much time playing but are just looking for some brain teasing when have a moment to play.</p>

<h2 id="visual-and-audio-style">Visual and Audio Style</h2>

<p>It is a pixel style game with pixel sound and graphic. I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfxr.net">http://www.bfxr.net/</a> website to create pixel styled sound assets for free. The soundtrack is a royalty free pixel music from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYV-T-iMTuaLOPMyOQGFzw">PixelMusic</a> YouTube channel.</p>
