An infinite runner game in development for the HTC Vive using the Unreal Engine 4.

Stranded alone in a asteroid field after their engines fail, the player encounters a pod of celestial whales. In order to find their way home, players use their homing laser to latch on the leviathans while avoiding oncoming obstacles. Over the course of their journey, the character undergoes a transcendence, gaining an understanding of the whales' greater purpose.

After piecing together the musical snippets of their language, players reach an crescendo laden apotheosis as the whales draw closer to home​
